	was not due simply to the regions thatresponded maximally to that

	In the {G}erman language, interactions of nonidentical gendernouns

  abstract = {In Experiments 1 and 2, monkeys received 3-stage operations intended
	to serially disconnect parieto-preoccipital from striate cortex.
	At each stage (unilateral parieto-preoccipital removal, contralateral
	striate removal and posterior callosal transection) the monkeys were
	tested for retention of the landmark task, a visuospatial discrimination
	sensitive to the effects of bilateral parieto-preoccipital damage.
	To check the effectiveness of the disconnection, the monkeys were
	also tested after removal of the remaining parieto-preoccipital cortex.
	The results demonstrated that corticocortical inputs from striate
	cortex are crucial for the visuospatial functions of parieto-preoccipital
	cortex, just as they had been shown earlier to be crucial for the
	pattern discrimination functions of inferior temporal cortex. Relative
	to inferior temporal cortex, however, parieto-preoccipital cortex
	was found to be especially dependent on ipsilateral (as compared
	with contralateral) striate inputs. In Experiment 3, monkeys received
	bilateral lesions of either lateral on medial striate cortex and
	were tested on both a pattern discrimination task, to assess residual
	inferior temporal function, and the landmark task, to assess residual
	parieto-preoccipital function. The results indicated that the pattern
	discrimination functions of inferior temporal cortex are especially
	dependent on inputs from lateral striate cortex, whereas the visuospatial
	functions of parieto-preoccipital cortex are equally dependent on
	inputs from lateral and medial striate cortex. The relatively greater
	contribution to parieto-preoccipital than to inferior temporal cortex
	made by ipsilateral and medial striate inputs (representing contralateral
	and peripheral visual fields, respectively) can also be seen in the
	receptive field properties of parieto-preoccipital and inferior temporal
	neurons. The differences in the organization of striate inputs to
	these two cortical association areas presumably reflect differences
	in the processing required for spatial vs object vision.},

  abstract = {Background The fusiform gyrus (FG), or occipitotemporal gyrus, is
	thoughtto subserve the processing and encoding of faces. Of note,
	several studieshave reported that patients with schizophrenia show
	deficits in facialprocessing. It is thus hypothesized that the FG
	might be one brain regionunderlying abnormal facial recognition in
	schizophrenia. The objectivesof this study were to determine whether
	there are abnormalities in graymatter volumes for the anterior and
	the posterior FG in patients with chronicschizophrenia and to investigate
	relationships between FG subregions andimmediate and delayed memory
	for faces. Methods Patients were recruitedfrom the Boston VA Healthcare
	System, Brockton Division, and control subjectswere recruited through
	newspaper advertisement. Study participants included21 male patients
	diagnosed as having chronic schizophrenia and 28 malecontrols. Participants
	underwent high-spatial-resolution magnetic resonanceimaging, and
	facial recognition memory was evaluated. Main outcome measuresincluded
	anterior and posterior FG gray matter volumes based on high-spatial-resolutionmagnetic
	resonance imaging, a detailed and reliable manual delineationusing
	3-dimensional information, and correlation coefficients between FGsubregions
	and raw scores on immediate and delayed facial memory derivedfrom
	the Wechsler Memory Scale III. Results Patients with chronic schizophreniahad
	overall smaller FG gray matter volumes (10%) than normal controls.Additionally,
	patients with schizophrenia performed more poorly than normalcontrols
	in both immediate and delayed facial memory tests. Moreover, thedegree
	of poor performance on delayed memory for faces was significantlycorrelated
	with the degree of bilateral anterior FG reduction in patientswith
	schizophrenia. Conclusion These results suggest that neuroanatomicFG
	abnormalities underlie at least some of the deficits associated withfacial
	recognition in schizophrenia.},

	1B, phonologicalpriming was found for targets related to the dominant
	name of a picture,as well as for those related to a near-synonymous
	name. These results suggestthat phonological activation occurs for
	multiple lexical candidates. InExperiments 2A and 2B, semantic priming
	was found to arise earlier thanphonological priming. In Experiment
	3, no priming was found for words phonologicallyrelated to category
	associates, suggesting that the activation of suchitems is weak.
	Overall, the results are supportive of a cascaded processingmodel
	of lexicalization in which activation spreads continuously from semanticto
	phonological levels of representation.}

  abstract = {Lesion evidence indicates that words from different lexical categories,such
	as nouns and verbs, may have different cortical counterparts. In
	thisstudy, processing of nouns and verbs was investigated in the
	intact brainusing (i) behavioral measures, (ii) stimulus-triggered
	event-related potentialsand (iii) high-frequency electrocortical
	responses in the gamma band. Nounsand verbs carefully matched for
	various variables, including word frequency,length, arousal and valence,
	were presented in a lexical decision taskwhile electrocortical responses
	were recorded. In addition, informationabout cognitive processing
	of these stimuli was obtained using questionnairesand reaction times.
	As soon as ~200 ms after stimulus onset, event-relatedpotentials
	disclosed electrocortical differences between nouns and verbsover
	widespread cortical areas. In a later time window, 500-800 ms afterstimulus
	onset, there was a significant difference between high-frequencyresponses
	in the 30 Hz range. Difference maps obtained from both event-relatedpotentials
	and high-frequency responses revealed strong betweencategorydifferences
	of signals recorded above motor and visual cortices. Behavioraldata
	suggest that these different physiological responses are related
	tosemantic associations (motor or visual) elicited by these word
	groups.Our results are consistent with a neurobiological model of
	language representationpostulating cell assemblies with distinct
	cortical topographies as biologicalcounterparts of words. Assemblies
	representing nouns referring to visuallyperceived objects may include
	neurons in visual cortices, and assembliesrepresenting action verbs
	may include additional neurons in motor, premotorand prefrontal cortices.
	Event-related potentials and high-frequency responsesare proposed
	to indicate two different functional states of cell assemblies:initial
	full activation (`ignition') and continuous reverberatory activity.},

  abstract = {{gamma} -Band activity (GBA) in electroencephalograms (EEGs) has been
	shownto reflect various cognitive processes. GBA has typically been
	recordedin the 30-60 Hz range in scalp EEGs. Recently, task-related
	"high GBA"(HGBA) with frequencies up to 100 Hz has been observed
	in studies withinvasive electrocorticograms (ECoGs). In the present
	study, we recordedECoGs from the bilateral basal temporal cortices
	in a patient with epilepsyand evaluated the task-related HGBA (most
	prominently in the 80-120 Hzrange) accompanying picture-naming and
	lexical-decision tasks. We examinedpicture naming using two categories
	(line drawings of animals and tools).The lexical-decision task was
	performed using words and pseudowords oftwo distinct Japanese writing
	forms, kanji (morphograms) and kana (syllabograms).Task-related HGBA
	was observed bilaterally during the naming task. Recordingsfrom some
	electrodes revealed significant differences in HGBA between animaland
	tool pictures. In contrast to the naming task, there was apparent
	leftdominance in the lexical-decision task. Furthermore, significant
	differencesin HGBA were observed between the Japanese kanji and kana
	words and betweenthe kanji words and kanji pseudowords. A number
	of differences in the HGBAobserved in the recordings from the basal
	temporal area were consistentwith previous findings from neuroimaging
	and patient studies and suggestthat HGBA is a good correlate of visual
	cognitive functions. }

	it was possible to comparevisual and verbal modalities and the same
	pattern of dissociation was observedin both. For 1 patient, comprehension
	of abstract words was significantlysuperior to comprehension of concrete
	words. Consistency of responses wasrecorded within a modality in
	contrast to a much lesser degree of consistencybetween modalities.
	We interpret our findings in terms of category specificityin the
	organization of meaning systems that are also modality specificsemantic
	systems. },
