@article{wackycorpora2009,
abstract = {This article introduces ukWaC, deWaC and itWaC, three very large corpora of English, German, and Italian built by web crawling, and describes the methodology and tools used in their construction. The corpora contain more than a billion words each, and are thus among the largest resources for the respective languages. The paper also provides an evaluation of their suitability for linguistic research, focusing on ukWaC and itWaC. A comparison in terms of lexical coverage with existing resources for the languages of interest produces encouraging results. Qualitative evaluation of ukWaC versus the British National Corpus was also conducted, so as to highlight differences in corpus composition (text types and subject matters). The article concludes with practical information about format and availability of corpora and tools.},

abstract = {The paper describes the architecture of an integrated and extensible corpus query system developed at the University of Stuttgart and gives examples of some of the modules realized within this architecture. The modules form the core of a corpus workbench. Within the proposed architecture, information required for the evaluation of queries may be derived from different knowledge sources (the corpus text, databases, on-line thesauri) and by different means: either through direct lookup in a database or by calling external tools which may infer the necessary information at the time of query evaluation. The information available and the method of information access can be stated declaratively and individually for each corpus, leading to a flexible, extensible and modular corpus workbench.},

abstract = {Of all the major world languages, Japanese is lagging behind in terms of publicly accessible and searchable corpora. In this paper we describe the development of JpWaC, a large corpus of 400 million words of Japanese web text, and its encoding for the Sketch Engine. The Sketch Engine is a web-based corpus query tool that supports fast concordancing, grammatical processing, ‘word sketching ’ (one-page summaries of a word’s grammatical and collocational behaviour), a distributional thesaurus, and robot use. We describe the steps taken to gather and process the corpus, and the development of a shallow grammar for Japanese to enable word sketching. We believe that the Japanese web corpus as loaded into the Sketch Engine will be a useful resource for a wide number of Japanese researchers, learners, and NLP developers.},

abstract = {The World Wide Web has grown so big, in such an anarchic fashion, that it is difficult to describe. One of the evident intrinsic characteristics of the World Wide Web is its multilinguality. Here, we present a technique for estimating the size of a language-specific corpus given the frequency of commonly occurring words in the corpus. We apply this technique to estimating the number of words available through Web browsers for given languages. Comparing data from 1996 to data from 1999 and 2000, we calculate the growth of a number of European languages on the Web. As expected, non-English languages are growing at a faster pace than English, though the position of English is still dominant. Introduction In their attempt to understand the anarchically expanding World Wide Web, researchers have been trying to estimate a variety of Web characteristics (Bray 96},

abstract = {We present an approach to language-specific query-based sampling which, given a single document in a target language, can find many more examples of documents in that language, by automatically constructing queries to access such documents on the world wide web. We propose a number of methods for building search queries to quickly obtain documents in the target language. They perform accurately and efficiently for building a corpus of documents in Tagalog starting from a single seed document, when these documents are only 2.5% of the documents in a collection. We found that sampling with a query consisting of a word seleccted according to its probability from the minority language corpus constructed so far was very successful. This method built a corpus of documents with word frequencies similar to those in the corpus based on all Tagalog documents in our collection, and required a relatively small number of search queries. It also quickly acquired a good c...},

The paper describes the strategies we employed, and the solutions to problems encountered. We believe we have a good model for corpus creation for lexicography, and others may find it useful as a blueprint. The corpus has two parts, one Irish, the other Hiberno-English (English as spoken in Ireland). We describe its design, collection and encoding.},
